# tc2000-backtest-trades
This program visualizes stock trades by generating candlestick charts for 10 randomly selected stocks. It reads trade data from a CSV file and uses yfinance for historical stock data. Charts are plotted with buy and sell markers for easy analysis, helping traders quickly understand their trading history and market movements.


1st download your trades from tc2000 in a cvs file. 
Then uploaded to chatgpt and ask it to "label the trades as open or close trades, then make a downloadable file"
take that file, name it "example trades" and upload it in the same folder as this program. 

I suggest just using the google colab chrome extention to open this file in seconds.
